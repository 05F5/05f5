Many OSS projects are individual programs or tools which address a section of a process or value chain 
(a survey tool, a modeling application, a security component, etc.). Unfortunately, building the pricing and 
business models can feel like a contortionists act and larger customer segments can be too distant in the value 
chain.

The topic of this workshop is how can several open source projects work together to serve one value or process 
chains, creating more natural pricing models and access to new markets. First, is that a good idea? When is it a 
good idea? If they do join forces... then how structurally should they? How do projects maintain autonomy, and 
what functions should be centralized? What successful examples can we find?
