Alexis Richardson, CEO and founder of Weaveworks as well as of RabbitMQ, takes a hard look at what went wrong 
at Weaveworks, which went under in January 2024 after an acquisition fell through. He’ll make specific comparisons 
with Isovalent, a company of similar size and age that was acquired recently by Cisco. He’ll talk about the specific
ways that Weaveworks and Isovalent differed, from the relationship between product and project to the importance 
of prioritizing ARR over ad-hoc deals. Each point will have specific takeaways for the audience about what to do, 
and not to do, to maximize chances of success in their OSS business.
