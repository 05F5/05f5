In this talk, Thomas di Giacomo will go into specifics about how product management has to be managed differently in open source companies.

Heâ€™ll talk about:

*   How you might not have full control over 95% of the full roadmap, and how to ensure you make full use of the 5% you do control
*   The specifics of pricing open source products
*   Managing the lifecycle of your project and your product, and the difference between the two
*   Being intentional about engaging developers in your project and product

Expect to come away with concrete ideas about how to manage the relationship between product and project from a product management point of view.
