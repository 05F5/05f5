We get over 60% of leads from our content, written or delivered at conferences around the globe by our own 
engineers (not marketing people!) I magnify their voices, help them hone their stories, and connect to their 
audience of peers with impactful content. And oftentimes, it requires a lot of motivating engineers (we’ve 
tried dozens of perks!) to contribute their stories beyond the solutions they build. Oh, yes, and motivate 
their bosses to take a closer look at our solutions and services. I’m ready to share our discoveries.
