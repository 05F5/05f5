In this talk, we dig into the creation of a mission-driven enterprise that commercializes Scikit-learn, a 
publicly sponsored open-source library for Machine Learning. Our objective is to sustainably balance governance, 
profitability, and public interest. We explore strategies for securing funding while maintaining commitment to 
keeping the project's integrity as a perpetual open source asset. By innovating on revenue models that ensure 
financial viability without compromising accessibility, we aim to establish a competitive stance in the 
marketplace and contribute positively towards an equitable knowledge economy.
