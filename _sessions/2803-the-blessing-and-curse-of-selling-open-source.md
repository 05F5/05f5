Sales is the lifeblood of any startup, but what makes a good open source sales strategy, and what makes a 
good open source sales person?

Maybe there's no difference to selling proprietary software, but then perhaps the differences are enough for you 
to change how you think about structuring your entire go to market.

This presentation will clear up the confusion and give you clear practical advice on how to succeed in open source sales.

It will take you through some of the blessings of open source, and how to take advantage of them, and some of the 
curses to be aware of, and how to mitigate, or avoid them altogether.

Whether you're an open source founder, sales person, or you're just trying to level up your commercial knowledge, 
come and learn from someone who's done this the hard way, both for himself, and with a variety of vendors.
