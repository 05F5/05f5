In this talk, Peter Zaitsev, founder and former CEO of Percona, will talk about the ways that your 
sales process has to change as you go from selling to smaller companies to landing enterprise customers. 

He’ll talk about the composition of your sales team, ensuring sales incentives are aligned with your business 
goals, the role of the founder(s) in sales as the company matures and how your offering has to change if you’re 
going to meet the expectations of enterprise customers. He’ll also address what’s unique about enterprise sales 
for open source companies. In other words, everything you need to do to land more enterprise deals.
