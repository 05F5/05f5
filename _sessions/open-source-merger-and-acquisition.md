Questions about how being an M&A target is different for open source companies compared to proprietary software 
companies? Join Thomas di Giacomo for an interactive workshop that will cover the entire lifecycle of the M&A

fall through and how to increase the chances that all parties will be satisfied after the acquisition happens.
