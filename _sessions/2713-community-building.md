In this workshop, we will talk about how your project can build and sustain an active contributor community, without 
overwhelming your core team. How do you attract contributors, guide them towards submitting work that moves your 
project forward, and make good use of maintainers’ time for reviewing community contributions?

I’ll kick things off with a brief overview of how we manage our contributor community at Zulip, where major 
releases have code contributions from over 100 people, with a core team of less than 15. I’ll talk about how 
we treat the contribution process as a product in its own right, and some things we’ve figured out along the 
way about onboarding, documentation, communication, the review process, prioritization, etc.

Please come with your questions, insights, and stories to share!
