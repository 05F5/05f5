Financing Open Source work is not an easy task, and running an Open
Source business is even more tricky. This quickly leads to questions
about what is acceptable to run the business while still being
attached to the Open Source philosophy.

Open core, SaaS, dual licensing are all examples of potential business
models that may or may not be problematic (think of the recent trend
of companies changing licenses to help their business). Hiring people
with no open source background changes the culture of the company and
may lead to a loss of interest in open source for some internal
services, potentially loosing the initial spirit of the company and
contact with the community. Some temporary financial troubles may lead
to difficult decisions that may look incompatible with the open source
ethics. Many events in a company can challenge the balance between
business and open source.

We have no doubt that every attendee here is experiencing on a daily
basis the difficulty of balancing the business needs and the open
source principles. With this workshop, we want to encourage everyone
to share their experience on this topic. What have you tried? What has
failed, and why? What has succeeded, and do you recommend this
approach? Is this balancing or is this compromising too much? What is
your red line?"
