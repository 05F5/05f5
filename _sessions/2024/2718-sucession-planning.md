Perhaps, like me, you want to program until it's time to be carried out horizontally. Or perhaps you want to 
step away to smell the roses, climb mountains, write a cookbook, or something else on your bucket list. But your 
FOSS business needs a plan to continue without your participation. What is your vision for your business without 
you at the helm? How do you plan to make that vision a reality?

As a programmer since 1970, although I am in good health, I want to ensure that YottaDB survives me. I think 
about it often. While we have a continuity plan, I confess to not having a succession plan.

If you are also concerned about the ongoing future of your FOSS business, please join our Succession Planning 
breakout workshop. Share your concerns, your ideas, and your plans. Let us learn from one another.
