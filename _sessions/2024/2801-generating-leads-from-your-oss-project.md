Want to use your open source project as a way to get more inbound commercial leads? In this talk, 
Frank Karlitschek, CEO of NextCloud, will talk about how NextCloud gets between 80 and 90 commercial 
leads every day, of which around 10 are generally well-qualified. He’ll talk about how he’s gotten 
to the point of generating so many leads from the open source project, the effort NextCloud puts into 
the qualification process, what levers there are to increase either the number of leads or their quality 
when needed, and how leads that come through the open source project are converted to paying commercial 
customers.
