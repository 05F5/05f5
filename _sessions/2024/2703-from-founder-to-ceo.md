The skills needed to effectively lead a company aren’t necessarily the same as those needed to build an open source 
project or to start a company. In this talk, Gaël Duval draws on his experience as CEO and founder at Mandrake, 
Ulteo and now Murena to talk about how founders of open source companies can become more effective CEOs. Expect 
practical advice you can put into practice immediately as well as lessons that Gaël has learned the hard way.
