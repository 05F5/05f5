Join us for an interactive workshop where we'll dive into the world of quantitative open source 
GTM (Go-To-Market) strategies. Many OSS startups find themselves operating with primitive frameworks 
when it comes to measuring and optimizing their GTM motion. In this session, we'll explore why relying 
solely on distant proxy metrics for your customer funnel may not be enough to drive reliable growth. 
Through a blend of expertise sharing and collaborative discussion, we'll equip founders with a data-driven 
framework to enhance their marketing, sales, and GTM operations.

Attendees will have the opportunity to 
not only learn tangible ways to measure their users' journey but also engage in conversations to deepen 
their understanding of the efficacy of their initiatives. Let's work together to shift the paradigm and 
level the playing field against proprietary competitors by mastering quantitative GTM strategies in the 
open source community.
