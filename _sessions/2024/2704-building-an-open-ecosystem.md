Building an open source business is never a lonely journey: you get to take along many stakeholders, from 
your community contributors, to customers and of course ecosystem players building on top of your technology. 
This is particularly true when you are trying to create an open network for communication like Matrix: success 
relies on how many users participate in it, and can only be accelerated by having as many other players using 
the technology to power their business as possible. However you still need to ensure that you can pay your 
employees and that your company is growing, which can create some pretty paradoxical situations. This talk 
will share our experience in trying to replace email and the phone network with an open communication network 
(Matrix), whilst keeping the commercial company (Element) on a growth trajectory. Spoiler alert: not for the 
faint of heart!
