In this interactive workshop, Emily Omier will help explore the art of positioning open source companies for success.

The session will cover how to create a clear, differentiated narrative that resonates with your target audience

direct feedback to refine their messaging and build stronger, more compelling value propositions for their 
open-source businesses.
