Your open source community’s needs are not necessarily aligned with your customers’ needs – so how do you find a 
balance between the needs and desires of your open source community and the needs and desires of the customers who 
are paying your bills? 

In this talk, Ann Schlemmer will talk about how she manages this balance at Percona, particularly when there appear 
to be conflicts in what the two stakeholder communities want.
