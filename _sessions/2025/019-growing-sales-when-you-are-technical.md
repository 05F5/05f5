Open source funders typically have a technical background and they build a
team of tech-savvy developers around them. They build a great product and
can have some reasonsable success thanks to word of mouth in the
community. But how can they go past this step and grow outside of their
small circle?

In this workshop, we will try to answer that question, by letting
participants share what they have tried, and by brainstorming what
else we could try.

Building a sales team or outsourcing sales are obvious options, but it's
not trivial if you want to stay true to your open-source values.
