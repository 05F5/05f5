This will be a hands on workshop and requires participation from attendees.
Matt will use some of the questioning he uses to help uncover some of the foundational pieces 
needed to build a growth framework.

Founders will learn more about some of the gaps they are missing, and how to think about filling them.
We will focus on:
- Vision and Mission
- Elevator pitch
- Hypothetical Inbound

This is a very short session, so we will cover as much of this as time allows.
