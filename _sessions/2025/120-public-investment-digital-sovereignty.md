Governments worldwide are investing heavily in digital sovereignty, creating new opportunities for open source companies.

This workshop will explore how open source businesses can align with public initiatives to secure funding, partnerships, and visibility.
We’ll look at real-world examples, such as projects supported by the European Commission and national funds,
and discuss the expectations and challenges of working with public sector stakeholders.

Participants will work through practical exercises on identifying relevant programs, crafting strong proposals,
and positioning their open source projects to meet digital sovereignty goals.

Whether you’re looking to fund growth, strengthen community impact, or simply better understand the public funding landscape,
this session will equip you with actionable strategies to connect open source innovation with government support.
