Every open-source founder knows the struggle: great adoption ≠ great revenue.

When we launched Gatling, we had an engaged community and a tool engineers loved. But turning that into a 
sustainable business was another story. What seemed like obvious revenue streams didn’t work, and it took 
multiple pivots—and painful lessons—before we finally found the right model.

This talk is a candid look at the realities of monetizing open source—what we got wrong, what finally worked, 
and why the journey is rarely linear.
