In this time of increasing regulation of software, and therefore of open source, how can your open source 
company leverage the strengths of an Open Source Foundation without getting caught in potential traps? 

This workshop is designed for founders focused on building commercially successful and sustainable open source 
businesses. Presented by Gaël Blondelle and Florent Zara of the Eclipse Foundation, we'll move beyond the basics 
to tackle the core strategic questions: What tangible benefits can a foundation offer your business? What are 
the real risks and how can they be mitigated? We'll cover avoiding common misunderstandings, aligning
expectations, and identifying the scenarios where foundation involvement provides maximum leverage – and 
when it might be a distraction. Expect practical insights and a forum for sharing experiences, ensuring you 
leave with concrete ideas for navigating foundation relationships strategically. 

If you already work with a foundation, you're also more than welcome to come and share your experience.
