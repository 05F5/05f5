Do you wonder how M&A is different for open source companies compared to other software companies? 
Join Thomas di Giacomo for an interactive workshop that will cover the entire lifecycle of the M&A 
process for open source companies â€” from how to make your company more attractive as an M&A target 
to why open source acquisitions fall through and how to increase the chances that all parties will 
be satisfied after the acquisition happens.
