Lots of founders dream of a charitable / non-profit foundation entity
parallel to their company to hold various assets for the
community. This workshop will look at some of the benefits and costs
of this, and at different structures and jurisdictions and how well
they can work. Interesting questions of where to stash your
trademarks, how to manage multi-vendor conflict and competition, the
value of charitable tax reliefs vs. compliance costs will be
discussed.

Michael helps to manage the FLOSS Foundations mailing list which a
forum for discussion for the leadership of most of the world's FLOSS
foundations, and helped to found The Document Foundation.
