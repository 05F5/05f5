In this track, there is no pre-set agenda. Instead, participants decide together what topics they want to discuss.
Anyone can propose a session on the spot (a discussion, a workshop, a Q&A) and people join the ones they're 
interested in. It's informal, fast-paced, and focused on sharing real experiences and solving real problems.
