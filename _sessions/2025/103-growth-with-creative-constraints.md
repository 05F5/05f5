At Ghost.org we consistently make choices that don’t make sense to others. We’ve grown to a team of 30 
and $8m/year in revenue while staying true to our values and putting unusual constraints on the way we work. 
If you’re struggling to balance open source values and growth, or you’re feeling overworked and overwhelmed, 
this talk will give concrete examples of how we’ve grown without sacrificing our values or our sanity.
