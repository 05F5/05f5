There’s been a lot of talk in the industry about new models for funding open source projects, with
names like Post Open or Fair Source. In this workshop, we’ll talk about those initiatives and why 
I don’t think it’s time to give up on a model that’s built around open source as it’s currently defined. 
There are plenty of examples of successful open source projects and successful businesses built around 
them. Join me to talk more about the ‘alternatives’ to open source being discussed in the ecosystem.
