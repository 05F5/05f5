DataStax CTO and co-founder Jonathan Ellis is now starting a new open source company after DataStax’s 
acquisition. In this talk, he’ll talk about the concrete things he’s planning to do differently at the new 
company, so you can learn from his experiences and apply the lessons from DataStax at your own company.
