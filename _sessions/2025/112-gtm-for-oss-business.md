How does your open source project fit into your go to market strategy — and in fact, is your open source 
project fundamentally a go to market play? In this talk, Rod Johnson will draw on his experience at SpringSource,
Atomist and as an advisor for multiple other open source companies to talk about when you should use your open
source project as a go to market strategy and how to get the most out of open source’s GTM potential.
