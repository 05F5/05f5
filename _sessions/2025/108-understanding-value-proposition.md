You can only generate revenue if you create value for your customers.
This simple idea is often overlooked, yet it's the cornerstone of all
successful marketing, including in commercial open source.

This interactive workshop invites participants to explore why
customer value matters and how it informs positioning, messaging, tone
of voice, content marketing, and more. Together, we’ll examine how
customer value shifts across the phases of the customer journey and
how these align with the marketing funnel, while highlighting what’s
unique for open source vendors.

Rather than a lecture, the session will blend strategic input with
collaborative activities, group discussions, and real-life examples.
Participants will work through practical exercises on how to design
and conduct effective customer interviews and surveys, understand the
balance between qualitative (insight-rich) and quantitative
(data-rich) data, and explore how AI can support faster insight
generation.

Whether you're launching or growing your open source business, you’ll
walk away with shared insights, actionable methods, and peer feedback
to help ensure your product delivers real value to your customers.
