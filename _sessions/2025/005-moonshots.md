This is the space to pitch your moonshots, the big, audacious dreams that could make you and this community soar.

- What if we could launch a mentoring program for open source founders?
- What if we created an incubator designed specifically for tiny OSS startups, where they get all the love, cash, and resources they need to thrive?
- What if we came up with a new investment vehicle for open source projects that blows traditional VC models out of the water?
- What if we started pooling more resources together?
- What if we started bundling our services together?

If it sounds crazy, that's exactly the point. Let’s talk about the impossible, the audacious, and the downright 
unhinged ideas that could push the open-source world forward. 

Come for the wild ideas, stay for the highly questionable decisions!
