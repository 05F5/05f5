"Founders Therapy" is a relaxed, open forum where entrepreneurs and startup leaders can bring their real-world 
challenges. Here, you’ll find a supportive group of peers who’ve walked in your shoes, ready to offer empathy, 
share lessons learned, and even help brainstorm solutions.

Think of it as a casual group chat meets honest vent session, with no judgment and lots of genuine camaraderie.
