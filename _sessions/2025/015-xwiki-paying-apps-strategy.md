XWiki has an app store where users can pay for and download extensions. These apps are all licensed under a LGPL 
license; if someone was really motivated to get them for free, they could remove the payment logic and use it. 
It also means a competitor could theoretically use the code to create a competitive offering, but doing so 
would involve a certain amount of work (and it hasn’t happened yet). In this talk, Ludovic is going to discuss 
how this approach works, and how it is different from an open core strategy.
