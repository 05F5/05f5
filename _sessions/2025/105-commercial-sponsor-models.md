A classic open source founder dilemma - how to structure the open source community project on which the 
founder is building a commercial enterprise.

Project success is critical to business success.

In this interactive session, Amanda Brock leads a dives deep into the many facets of open source sponsorship:
- What project structuring options exist and how do they interact with commercial models?
- Why companies donate code to foundations or "stewards", and whatâ€™s in it for them?
- Are innovators being driven into foundations and stewards?
- Is there still room for foundations, or is the single-vendor model taking over?
- What happens when trademarks, governance, and money collide?
- Why did Syadia pull NATS from the CNCF, and what does that mean for everyone else?
- What alternative options exist for the future?
