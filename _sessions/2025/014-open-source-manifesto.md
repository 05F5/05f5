An Open Source Manifesto is a public document that defines an organization's approach to and relationship 
with open source. Although the manifesto may seem to contain only broad statements to those familiar with 
open source, it is a valuable tool for aligning collaborators on what open source means to the organization 
and for publicly communicating this vision.

This presentation will explore the advantages of having an Open Source Manifesto and discuss how Centreon 
utilized it to successfully restructure its open-source strategy.
