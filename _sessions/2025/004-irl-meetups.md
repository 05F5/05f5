In the early stages of open source development, cultivating a strong practitioner community can be a 
powerful force multiplier. This talk shares how Datastrato, creators of Apache Gravitino, built and scaled 
the Data for AI meetup into one of the Bay Area’s most active communities for senior data and AI engineers.

We’ll explore practical strategies for leveraging in-person, geographically grounded developer relations to 
foster engagement, drive adoption, and build credibility across a wide technical surface area—turning monthly 
meetups into sustained momentum for open source growth.
