If you started with a focus on a specific geographic area,
chances are that at some point you’ll want to start expanding
internationally. In this workshop, we’ll talk about tactics for doing
so, including the specific ways that you can use your open source
project to open doors outside of the geographic area you’d been
focused on previously.
