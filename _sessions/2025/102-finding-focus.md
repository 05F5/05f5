The difference between open source businesses and closed source ones, is that what you do is available for 
anyone to play with. You may as such end up with several competing markets to serve the one you simed for 
initially, the one that actually wants your software and the open source community which likes your software. 

This is what happened to us and trying to grow when pulled in 3 different directions is tough. Every startup 101 
litterature will tell you that focus is key. And that focus is hard. Well, we can now confirm all this, and this 
talk will share how we got there, the techniques we used, how we iterated, and the result 18 months later.
