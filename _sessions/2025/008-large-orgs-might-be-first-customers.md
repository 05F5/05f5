Startups often assume large enterprises are too slow, too bureaucratic, or hesitant to work with small 
companies. But what if big organizations were actually the best first customers for your open-source business?
Beyond revenue, large companies can provide credibility, stability, and valuable feedback, helping you shape 
both your product and business model. The key is understanding how to navigate their decision-making process, 
align with their needs, and turn complexity into an opportunity.

In this session, we’ll explore why, when, and how open-source startups can successfully engage large enterprises
— and why they might be your biggest growth accelerator.
