Does being an open source company make it easier, harder or just different to find product-market fit? 
What is the relationship between product-market fit and project-market fit? How does being open source 
affect product strategy? In this breakout workshop, Lisa Cao will lead a discussion about the trials and 
wins of getting to product-market fit as an open source company.
