How do we create momentum for positive network effects in an open platform? Do we focus on the chicken or 
the egg first? What convinces individuals and companies to contribute to a new ecosystem? In what ways is 
openness helpful, and when is it a burden? How do we create short-term value without losing the long-term perspective?  I will share what I have learned in my work to create a compelling value proposition, and I look forward to hearing your experiences and insights.
