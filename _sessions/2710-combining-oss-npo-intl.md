MobilityData, a non-profit organization, dedicates itself to enhancing traveler information through improved data. 
The intersection of a non-profit organization with an international scope of work, all in the open source ecosystem 
makes it an interesting way of doing business. 

Despite the modest size of our team, comprising less than 25 individuals, we manage an impressive array of 
approximately a dozen different products within our open-source community. Our daily operations are significantly 
influenced by various factors, including policymakers mandating our standards or other organizations requesting 
us to host new projects and standards, and occasional (regular) uncertainties regarding funding. 

However, amidst these challenges, we continuously refine 
our business model, striving to make a meaningful impact on millions of individuals worldwide by providing 
enhanced traveler information through data.
