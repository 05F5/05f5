Just because you 10x your number of open source users doesn’t mean you’ll 10x your paying customers. 
In this talk, Michael ‘Monty’ Widenius will talk about how to both increase your open source adoption while 
also growing your customer base, and why increasing one will not necessarily increase the other. He’ll also 
cover how to make sure you understand the relationship between the users and customers — how are they the same 
and how are they different? How are their needs the same and different? Expect practical growth strategies you 
can put into practice in your business.
