For many open source companies, the open source strategy revolves around getting widespread adoption, 
then translating that adoption into financial success. Yet the truth is that just having an open source 
project does not guarantee widespread adoption, and even if you do get widespread adoption translating 
that adoption into financial success turns out to be much harder than many founders expect. 

In this talk, Garima Kapoor, founder of MinIO, will talk about how MinIO has managed to get widespread 
adoption, including in major companies, and how they have managed to convert adoption into revenue. 
Expect concrete strategies and tactics for both increasing your projectâ€™s reach and translating that reach 
into commercial success.
