In this talk, Pierre Burgy will go into detail about how the GTM flywheel for a SaaS offering differs dramatically 
from the GTM process if you’re following an open core model. He’ll go into specifics about what has had to change 
at Strapi as they’ve moved from focusing on an open core model to launching a SaaS product and putting increasing 
focus on building the SaaS business. 

He’ll also talk about how adding a SaaS product has influenced the tension 
(in a good way) between products and the open source project, and how the decision to focus on enterprise sales 
or on SaaS can and should be influenced by what kind of company you want to build.
