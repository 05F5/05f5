There are many fears about having large organizations as customers: “sales cycles are too long”, “the 
decision-making process is complicated”, “they don’t want to deal with small companies”. What if your 
first customer was a large organization! Targeting large organizations isn’t related to the stage of 
your company, but to your business strategy. It’s even more important since large organizations aren’t 
just buying your product: They’re investing their trust and money in your company, sometimes with 5, 6 
or even 7-figure deals!

This workshop will explore how open source businesses can effectively attract and manage large-scale clients, 
thanks to a robust business strategy. We will address different tactical approaches to engage with large 
clients, emphasizing that each company's strategy must be distinctively crafted to succeed in this challenging 
yet rewarding market.
