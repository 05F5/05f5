Did HashiCorp change its licensing model to discourage cloud providers from offering their open-source 
software as a service (SaaS) without contributing back? Did the company later sold to IBM seeking 
greater resources and market reach? Does this move signify the end of single-vendor 
open-source software? Or does it highlight ongoing challenges and upcoming adaptations in the ecosystem?

Join Amanda Brock's workshop to explores these dynamics and their implications for the industry.
