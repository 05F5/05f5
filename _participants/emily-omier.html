<blockquote></blockquote>
<p>
    I help founders of open source startups accelerate revenue growth.
    I'm a big picture person â€” I'm good at helping people zoom out and think about how their project/product
    helps customers' bottom lines and how their project/product fits into the larger ecosystem. I've worked
    with dozens of startups and interviewed hundreds of founders, operators and investors on my podcast, The
    Business of Open Source, and have seen the patterns of what works and what doesn't.
