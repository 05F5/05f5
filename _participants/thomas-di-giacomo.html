<blockquote>
    "It is important to me that founders are successful when they create and make a difference.
    And that open source enables such successes as it should! One of the myths in our industry is that
    combining innovation and adoption, both highly facilitated by open source, triggers success.
    Unfortunately, this is not true per se. To be commercially successful, you need to be intentional
    and specific with your plans, taking into account the open source specifics.<br><br>
    To learn about them and how to act accordingly, join OSFS!"
</blockquote>
<p>
    Thomas is Chief Technology and Product Officer for SUSE where he leads the Office of the CTO,
    Engineering and Product Management across the whole portfolio. SUSE technologies and innovation
    are all and whole open source, as such the team is highly engaged in various open source projects
    and foundations. Thomas has been elected to the Governing Board of the Cloud Native Computing
    Foundation since 2017.
