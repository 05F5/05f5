<p>
    Matt has built his career on being on the leading edge of open source software. As a graduate, he joined
    the startup Canonical, where he managed to convince Asian computer manufacturers to pre-install Ubuntu
    instead of pirated Windows. He then moved on to become the bain of Oracle DBAs lives by joining fledgling
    NoSQL company MongoDB.
</p>
<p>
    In 2015 he achieved his dream by co-founding a start-up around Kubernetes called Jetstack. Matt
    bootstrapped the company, and grew to 30 people before being acquired by the identity leader Venafi in 2020.
</p>
<p>
    In the process of providing Kubernetes services, Jetstack created one of the most-popular cloud native
    projects in the ecosystem, ‘cert-manager’ which is downloaded millions of times a day to secure cloud native
    infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
    Since joining Venafi, Matt has led their Global Cloud Native practice, and is building on cert-manager
    to explore new areas like workload identity. In January 2021 Matt was awarded as a top 100 Open Source
    Influencer by OpenUK.
