<p>
    Ivan co-founded Codeanywhere, a pioneer in cloud development back in 2009. He also established Shift,
    a premier developer conference in SE Europe, which was later acquired by Infobip—a worldwide communications
    cloud giant—in 2021. Following the acquisition, Ivan served as the Chief Developer Experience Officer at Infobip,
    overseeing global developer-oriented operations. Recently, he embarked on a new journey by co-founding Daytona,
    a platform dedicated to standardized development environments, reigniting the mission initiated by Codeanywhere
    over a decade ago as he is dedicated to empowering developers and revolutionizing how they work.
