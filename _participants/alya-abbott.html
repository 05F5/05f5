    I’m working on our sales and marketing strategy, and would love to meet other leaders in open-source
    companies, and learn about what’s worked for them.

    For the past 3 years, Alya Abbott has been leading product, marketing, and community efforts at Zulip, a
    100% open-source organized team chat app. Her role runs the gamut from high-level strategy to getting UX
    details just right. Before joining Zulip, Alya managed data science teams at Lyft and Upwork. She’s always
    happy to chat about linguistics, travel, bridge or dinosaurs.
