    Florent has been involved (both personally and professionally) in the FLOSS community since 1999. Professionally,
    Florent has worked for nearly 20 years in a consulting company as an Open Source advisor for large companies,
    helping them with software quality, Open Source governance, licensing, Innersource, as well as change management.
    Today, as Open Source Services Team Lead, he’s helping (new) Eclipse members and projects better understand,
    manage and master Open Source. He also participates actively in the OSPO Alliance and the Good Governance
    Initiative. On his personal side, he’s an administrator and board member at LinuxFr.org (reference
    French-speaking, community-driven website about Free and Open Source software).
