    Amandine is COO and co-founder for Element, an open source, secure and interoperable collaboration tool built
    on Matrix, the unique initiative aiming to democratise secure online communication and solve the problem of
    fragmentation in current Chat, VoIP, VR and IoT technologies.
</p><p>
    Matrix, which Amandine also co-founded, hopes to create a new ecosystem that makes open real-time-communication
    as universal and interoperable as email, and brings the power back to the user on choosing who they trust
    with their data and how they want to communicate. Element delivers Matrix solutions to millions of users,
    including the German Armed Forces, the US Navy, NATO, and private companies like Mozilla.
