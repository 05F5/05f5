<p>
    Bhaskar wrote his first computer program in 1970. As an electrical engineer, computer scientist, business
    executive, and lately entrepreneur, he has programmed computers ranging from room-sized benemoths that would
    be computationally dwarfed by a 2023 door-bell all the way to today's Linux servers. He has used FOSS since
    the mid 1990s, managed FOSS since 2001, and in 2017 founded YottaDB, a 100% FOSS company focused on database
    engines with NoSQL+SQL access, used in secure, mission-critical applications such as large-scale core-banking
    and electronic medical records, but which also scales down to edge computing. 100% of his software, both
    professional and personal, is released under free / open source software licenses.

<p>
    In his personal work, to support his political activism, Bhaskar has developed a methodology and software
    for identifying members of ethnic & linguistic groups who are identifiable by their names.

<p>
    Bhaskar has used Linux as his primary computing environment since 1999, at work and at home.
