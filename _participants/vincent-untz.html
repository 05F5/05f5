<blockquote>
    OSFS will be a fantastic event to share and learn about building, running and growing open source companies:
    the attendees form a very specific community (it's not just open source, or just business, or just technical,
    or... it's a mix of all that), and this community deserves a dedicated event where it can meet and discuss
    the unique challenges that we are all facing on a daily basis.

    Vincent bootstrapped his career thanks to his passion for open source more than 20 years ago: heavily involved
    in all aspects of the GNOME project, he was recruited by SUSE to keep working on what he loved. He later became
    involved in openSUSE and in OpenStack. His involvement in the community covered all kinds of roles in various
    projects: contributor, reviewer, maintainer, release manager, director of a Foundation, chairman, and more!

    Today, Vincent is happy to mix his interests in open source, technology, people and strategy on a daily basis
    thanks to his role of CTO at Centreon.
