<blockquote>
    Open Source is the future of software. We see it in AI, we see it in the enterprise. The key challenge
    for many entrepreneurs is understanding how to create ongoing value from open source - for the community,
    for the company or project and for the stakeholders in that company/project. That is not a straightforward
    proposition and there are plenty of opinions. The Open Source Founders Summit is a great forum to engage
    in this conversation - openly, transparently and with a diversity of voices.
