<p>
    Open Source Entrepreneur, Creator of XWiki, Founder and CEO of XWiki SAS, building XWiki and CryptPad open source
    software.
</p>
<p>
    After 10 years in the Internet business, first as an Architect in the Professional Services Team of Netscape
    Communications Europe, then as CTO of the best technology startup in the Audience Measurement business NetValue,
    acquired later by Nielsen//NetRatings, I decided to create XWiki around Application Wikis and Collaboration.
</p>
<p>
    This has given birth to the Open-source software XWiki, which is used by more than 5000 organizations in the
    world, and is lead by XWiki SAS, a 40 persons independent company directed at helping companies make the best
    out of the XWiki technologies and solutions.
</p>
<p>
    We also build the CryptPad open-source software and cryptpad.fr cloud service, the first privacy by default
    end-to-end encrypted realtime collaboration tool. The server cannot read the content. We aim to build a
    no-tracking / no-ads privacy friendly service as an alternative to Google Docs / Dropbox. We provide today a
    drive, wysiwyg editing, kanban, polls, shared folders, and have experimental Office compatible editors.
