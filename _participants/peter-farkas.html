<p>
    Peter has been building sustainable open-source projects and businesses for the last 12 years.
    He currently serves as the Co-Founder and CEO of FerretDB, the truly Open Source MongoDB Alternative,
    which helps users to use MongoDB drivers seamlessly with PostgreSQL as the database backend.

    Peter believes that open source is as sustainable in terms of product and revenue growth as proprietary
    solutions, and more and more entrepreneurs will work on open source projects.
