<blockquote>
    "Open-source has won, it is everywhere. Our very lives depend on open-source software, we interact with
    it knowingly or unknowingly on a daily basis. But we haven't yet figured out how to sustain all of this
    software for decades or centuries to come. It's essential the people who have found individual workable
    solutions, collaborate and exchange ideas to help more projects accomplish the same. In particular,
    open-source businesses play a key role in answering the sustainability question."
