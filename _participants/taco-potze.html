<blockquote>
    The Open Source Founder Summit is vital because it addresses the unique challenges that only an open-source
    founder faces. Unlike normaal SaaS companies, those of us in the open-source realm grapple with the intricacies
    of maintaining code that must be both accessible and innovative, engaging with a diverse and vocal community,
    and crafting business models that respect our commitment to openness while ensuring sustainability. This summit
    provides a rare space for open-source founders to connect, share solutions and strengthen our collective resolve
    to thrive within these complex dynamics.
