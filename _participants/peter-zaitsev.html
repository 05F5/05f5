<blockquote>
    "Open source founders are such a minority compared to all company founders, and the open source ecosystem
    is so different compared to other businesses. So I think there’s a lot we can learn from being together
    at a conference. I also think that open source founders are very different from open source developers —
    very few open source developers would ever think about starting a company and doing a business."
