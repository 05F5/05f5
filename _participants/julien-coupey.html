<blockquote></blockquote>
<p>
    Julien is a co-founder of Verso, a spin-off from a French research
    institute focusing on solving complex vehicle routing problems. Verso's
    algorithms are in use at many logistics companies, including some big
    players.

    Julien has a background in Mathematics and Computer Science. After
    working for some time as a teacher, he moved on to developing
    optimization software for an applied research project. This lead him to
    become a "founder by accident", first to keep the fun going, then to try
    and figure out how one could possibly build a sustainable bootstrapped
    company developing its core project as open-source.
