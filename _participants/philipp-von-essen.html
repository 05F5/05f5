<p>
    Philipp is passionate about organizations, how they operate and develop work cultures, how they grow and
    evolve, and how these processes can be fostered and guided. His drive and optimism provided the initial
    spark for founding Knowledge Pixels. Philipp is fascinated by the idea of machines and humans meeting halfway,
    and is now working towards fundamentally improving science communication with Knowledge Pixels.
