<blockquote>
    I think it’s really, really important for founders to share their experience with others. I know that there
    are some other events where people are more focused on the venture capital side and they’re advocating
    for open core and other models that I don’t like too much. I really like what you’re doing here, bring
    together real open source founders to build real open source businesses.
