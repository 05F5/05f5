    Running an open source company for 20 years teaches you a lot of things. While such companies are no
    different from many businesses, open source software companies are unique in that you can’t really sell
    “free” software. Thus your business must be based around different products.
    I am eager to attend the Open Source Founders Summit to share my experiences with others that are either
    just starting out or who have open source companies, and I hope my stories will be useful.

    I have been involved in managing communications networks professionally since 1988, and unprofessionally
    since 1978 when I got my first computer - a TRS-80 from Radio Shack. Having worked as a network management
    consultant for many years, I was constantly frustrated in the lack of flexibility involved in commercial solutions
    such as OpenView and Tivoli, as well as shocked by their high prices. Looking for a better solution, I turned
    to open source and joined the OpenNMS project in 2001 and become the principal administrator of the project
    in 2002. The OpenNMS Group, the services company I created to maintain the project, was successful and at
    one point had three of the Fortune 5 companies as customers. It was sold in 2019 and I left the project in 2021.
