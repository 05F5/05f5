<blockquote>
    Building an open source business is hard. The idea of the Open Source Founders Summit started from the experience
    of seeing other founders of open source businesses somewhat disconnected from each others. I believe there is
    untapped potential in fostering collaboration across projects and products, sharing lesson learned, and overall
    just building a community to help each other out.

    Hi there! I am the co-organizer of the Open Source Founders Summit with
    <a href="{{ "/participants/emily-omier" | absolute_url }}">Emily Omier</a>.
    I am also the co-founder and CTO of Passbolt, an open source password manager designed for collaboration.
    I participate in the credential provider special interest group that is part of the Fido Alliance.

    I also make minor contributions to other open source projects, such as the CakePHP project, mostly giving a hand
    to the organizers of the annual developer event. In the past, I also worked on Mailvelope (a solution for end to end
    email encryption in the browser). While working for Greenpeace International, I also contributed as product owner
    to the early versions of Open Social (an open source community engagement platform).
