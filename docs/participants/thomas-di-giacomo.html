            <p><b><i> "It is important to me that founders are successful when they create and make a difference. And that open source enables such successes as it should! One of the myths in our industry is that combining innovation and adoption, both highly facilitated by open source, triggers success. Unfortunately, this is not true per se. To be commercially successful, you need to be intentional and specific with your plans, taking into account the open source specifics. </i></b></p>

           <ul>The specifics of pricing open source products</ul>
            <ul>Managing the lifecycle of your project and your product, and the difference between the two</ul>
            <ul>Being intentional about engaging developers in your project and product</ul>
    
</p>
        <p> Expect to come away with concrete ideas about how to manage the relationship between product and project from a product management point of view.
