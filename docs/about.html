            <h2>About</h2>
            <h3>Why this event?</h3>
            <p>Open source companies face challenges and opportunities that proprietary software companies never
                encounter. General startup programs, investors and your own employees often won’t understand
                how to navigate these challenges or take advantage of the opportunities unless they have open
                source experience. The open source founders summit gives founders a place to learn from each other
                and support each other in building open source companies.
            </p>
            <h3>
                What is different about OSFS?
            </h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Not organized by a venture firm.</strong> Unlike all the other open source business events,
                the primary organizers aren’t VCs — and including perspectives from both bootstrapped and venture-backed
                companies is important to us.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Not DevTool focused:</strong>  Many successful open source companies don’t make DevTools.
                We want all open source companies to be part of the conversation.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Practical info:</strong> You’re a busy founder. OSFS is all about actionable takeaways you
                can put into practice immediately and fresh perspectives on your biggest challenges.
            </p>
            <h3>A unique event format</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Morning talks:</strong> Single-track talks that are both thought-provoking and actionable. No
                panels.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Afternoon unconference workshops:</strong> Afternoon breakout sessions where you can discuss
                specific challenges, from community building to sales to revenue building to acquisitions.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Networking Breaks:</strong> Social events to provide plenty of time & space for one-on-one
                conversations.
            </p>
