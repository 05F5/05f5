            <h2>Event Code of Conduct</h2>
            <h3>Last updated: 13/02/2023</h3>
            <p>
                Open Source Founders Summit is dedicated to providing a harassment-free and inclusive event experience
                for everyone regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disabilities,
                neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion,
                or other protected category. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form.
                Open Source Founders Summit takes violations of our policy seriously and will respond appropriately.
            </p>
            <p>
                All participants of Open Source Founders Summit events must abide by the following policy:
            </p>
            <p>
                <h3>Be excellent to each other.</h3> We want the event to be an excellent experience for everyone regardless
                of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical
                appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, or other protected category.
                Treat everyone with respect. Participate while acknowledging that everyone deserves to be here --
                and each of us has the right to enjoy our experience without fear of harassment, discrimination, or
                condescension, whether blatant or via micro-aggressions. Jokes shouldnâ€™t demean others. Consider what
                you are saying and how it would feel if it were said to or about you.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h3>Speak up if you see or hear something.</h3> Harassment is not tolerated, and you are empowered to
                politely engage when you or others are disrespected. The person making you feel uncomfortable may
                not be aware of what they are doing, and politely bringing their behavior to their attention is
                encouraged. If a participant engages in harassing or uncomfortable behavior, the event organizers
                may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning or expelling the offender from the
                event with no refund. If you are being harassed or feel uncomfortable, notice that someone else is
                being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the event staff immediately.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h3>Harassment is not tolerated.</h3> Harassment includes, but is not limited to: verbal language that
                reinforces social structures of domination related to gender identity and expression, sexual
                orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality,
                race, age, religion, or other protected category; sexual imagery in public spaces; deliberate
                intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of
                talks or other events; offensive verbal language; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome
                sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
            </p>
            <h3>Applicability</h3>
            <p>
                This policy extends to talks, forums, workshops, codelabs, social media, parties, hallway
                conversations, all attendees, partners, sponsors, volunteers, event staff, etc. You catch our drift.
                Open Source Founders Summit reserves the right to refuse admittance to, or remove any person
                from, any Open Source Founders Summit hosted event (including future Open Source Founders Summit
                events) at any time in its sole discretion. This includes, but is not limited to, attendees
                behaving in a disorderly manner or failing to comply with this policy, and the terms and
                conditions herein. If a participant engages in harassing or uncomfortable behavior, the event
                organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning or expelling the offender
                from the event with no refund.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our event staff can usually be identified by special badges/attire. Our zero tolerance policy
                means that we will look into and review every allegation of violation of our Event Community
                Guidelines and Anti-Harassment Policy and respond appropriately. Please note, while we take
                all concerns raised seriously, we will use our discretion as to determining when and how to follow
                up on reported incidents, and may decline to take any further action and/or may direct the
                participant to other resources for resolution.
            </p>
            <p>
                Event staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement,
                provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing discomfort or harassment to feel safe for the
                duration of the event. We value your attendance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Exhibiting partners, sponsors or vendor booths, or similar activities are also subject to this
                policy. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material.
                Participants and exhibiting partners or sponsors disobeying this policy will be notified and are expected to stop any offending behavior immediately.
            </p>
            <h3>Why this policy is important</h3>
            <p>
                Harassment at events and in online communities is unfortunately common. Creating an official
                policy aims to improve this by making it clear that harassment of anyone for any reason is not
                acceptable within our events and communities. This policy may prevent harassment by clearly
                defining expectations for behavior, aims to provide reassurance, and encourages people who have
                had bad experiences at other events to participate in this one.
