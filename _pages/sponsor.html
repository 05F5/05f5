        The Open Source Founders Summit is the only event in the world that’s focused specifically on bringing
        together founders of open source companies of all kinds, whether they are VC-backed or bootstrapped, or DevTool companies or not.
        It’s also  the only event that’s focused on giving founders practical tools to navigate the unique challenges
        and opportunities of open source companies.
    </p><p>
        Sponsoring the event is a unique opportunity to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Position your organization as a supporter of open source businesses.</li>
        <li>Get in front of open source founders — if you’re not an open source founder, the only way to attend is as a sponsor.</li>
        <li>Be involved in Open Source Founders Summit from the beginning.</li>
    </ul>
