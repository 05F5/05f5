        <h1>The conference about building financially successful and sustainable open source companies.</h1>
        <h3>Do you ever feel like the entire startup ecosystem just doesn’t get your open source company?
        </h3>
        <p>Proprietary software founders don’t have to worry about how to build an open source project that’s
            good enough to be valuable to users — but not so good that it’s impossible to monetize.
            They don’t have to balance community and customers.
        </p>
        <p>But if you’re building an open source company, those are among your core strategic challenges.
            OSFS is a no-bullshit place where founders of open source companies can learn from and collaborate
            with each other to build more successful individual businesses and a stronger ecosystem of open source
            companies.</p>
