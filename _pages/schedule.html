    <p>
        The schedule for the 2025 edition is still very much a work in progress.
        It will follow the previous event format with lightnings talks, talks from industry leaders as well as
        deep-dive workshops. You can browse <a href="/2024/schedule">last year schedule</a> to get an idea.

        Our goal is to make this event as concretely useful to open source founders as possible. Weâ€™re counting on
        input from you to figure out what your top challenges are and how the open source founder summit
        can help you conquer them.
