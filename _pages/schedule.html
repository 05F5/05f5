        <p>
            This is a sample schedule to give you an idea of the event format — single track talks followed by workshops,
            both in the morning and afternoon. Join us in the evenings for networking and discussions over a drink.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our goal is to make this event as concretely useful to open source founders as possible. We’re counting on
            input from you to figure out what your top challenges are and how the open source founder summit
            can help you conquer them.
