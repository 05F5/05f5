        <p>
            The Open Source Founders Summit will be back in 2026!
            The schedule is still a work in progress, and we welcome proposals from anyone who wants to contribute a
            session. In the meantime, you can browse the
            <a href="/2025/schedule">2025</a> and
            <a href="/2024/schedule">2024</a> editions
            schedules to get a feel for the type of content and formats we’ve hosted in the past.
        </p>
        <h4>Event Format</h4>
        <p>
            Typicaly the event is organized on a single track talks followed by workshops, both in the
            morning and afternoon. You can also join us in the evenings for networking and discussions over a drink.
            Our goal is to make this event as concretely useful to open source founders as possible.
            We’re counting on input from you to figure out what your top challenges are and how the Open Source
            Founders Summit can help you conquer them.
