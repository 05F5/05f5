    <h3>Who is this for?</h3>
    <p>
        Want to join us at Open Source Founders Summit? We’d love to have you, but we also recognize
        that this event isn’t for everyone. Here’s what we’re looking for in attendees:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>You’re a founder</strong> or in high-level leadership at an open source company.</li>
        <li>You understand that this event is for learning and <strong>working on your business</strong>, not selling your product or pushing your project on other attendees.</li>
        <li>You’re willing and able to check your ego at the door. This event will work best if attendees are able to be honest with themselves and each other about what’s working in their business and what isn’t.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
