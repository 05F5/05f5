<h1>Request an invite</h1>
<h2>Why is an invitation required?</h2>
<h3>Who is this for?</h3>
<p>
    Want to join us at Open Source Founders Summit? We’d love to have you, but we also recognize
    that this event isn’t for everyone. Here’s what we’re looking for in attendees:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>You’re a founder</strong> or in high-level leadership at an open source company.</li>
    <li>You understand that this event is for learning and <strong>working on your business</strong>, not selling your product or pushing your project on other attendees.</li>
    <li>You’re willing and able to check your ego at the door. This event will work best if attendees are able to be honest with themselves and each other about what’s working in their business and what isn’t.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How can I contribute?</h3>
<p> Everyone who comes to Open Source Founders Summit has something to add to the conversation. This is also an opportunity for you to share your expertise and your lessons learned! </p>
<p> There are two formats for attendees to share their experiences with the group:</p>
<ul>
    <li> <strong>Lighting Talks</strong>: 5 minute talks with no slides.</li>
    <li> <strong>Breakout Workshops</strong>: Do a short introduction (around 5 minutes, no slides) on the topic, then moderate an interactive discussion. Can be with one or two moderators. </li>
</ul>
<p> If you’re interested in either doing a lighting talk or moderating a breakout session, <a href="https://app.formbricks.com/s/clr4szdit9hrz8up0g6ed664v">request an invitation</a> to the event and then buy a ticket! You’ll have a chance during the purchase process to tell us what topics you’d like to talk or lead a workshop on. </p>
<p> Note that you need to buy a ticket and get us your lighting talk or workshop abstract by <b> May 15, 2024</b> so we can put your talk or breakout workshop in the schedule. </p>
