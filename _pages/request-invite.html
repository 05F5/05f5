    <h1>Join us at OSFS 2025!</h1>
    <h2>Apply to join us in May</h2>
    <h3>Who is this for?</h3>
    <p>
        Want to join us at Open Source Founders Summit? We’d love to have you, but this event isn't for everyone. One of the things that makes OSFS different is that attendance is limitted to founders and leadership at open source companies — and we verify that everyone who gets a ticket meets those requirements. Here’s what we’re looking for in attendees:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>You’re a founder</strong> or in high-level leadership at an open source company.</li>
        <li>You understand that this event is for learning and <strong>working on your business</strong>, not selling your product or pushing your project on other attendees.</li>
        <li>You’re willing and able to check your ego at the door. This event will work best if attendees are able to be honest with themselves and each other about what’s working in their business and what isn’t.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> 
        If that describes you, the next step is to fill out a form in Pretix. Assuming you do in fact meet the criteria, we'll approve the request and then you'll be able to buy the tickets.
