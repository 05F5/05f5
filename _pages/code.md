# Event Code of Conduct
### Last updated: 13/02/2023

Open Source Founders Summit is dedicated to providing a harassment-free and inclusive event experience for 
everyone regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, 
physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, or other protected category. 
We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. Open Source Founders Summit takes violations 
of our policy seriously and will respond appropriately.

All participants of Open Source Founders Summit events must abide by the following policy:

### Be excellent to each other.

We want the event to be an excellent experience for everyone regardless of gender identity and expression, 
sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, 
race, age, religion, or other protected category. Treat everyone with respect. Participate while acknowledging 
that everyone deserves to be here -- and each of us has the right to enjoy our experience without fear of 
harassment, discrimination, or condescension, whether blatant or via micro-aggressions. Jokes shouldnâ€™t demean 
others. Consider what you are saying and how it would feel if it were said to or about you.

### Speak up if you see or hear something.

Harassment is not tolerated, and you are empowered to politely engage when you or others are disrespected. 
The person making you feel uncomfortable may not be aware of what they are doing, and politely bringing their 
behavior to their attention is encouraged. If a participant engages in harassing or uncomfortable behavior, 
the event organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning or expelling the offender 
from the event with no refund. If you are being harassed or feel uncomfortable, notice that someone else is being 
harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the event staff immediately.

### Harassment is not tolerated.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to: verbal language that reinforces social structures of domination 
related to gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, 
body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, or other protected category; sexual imagery in public 
spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of 
talks or other events; offensive verbal language; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention. 
Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

### Applicability

This policy extends to talks, forums, workshops, codelabs, social media, parties, hallway conversations, all 
attendees, partners, sponsors, volunteers, event staff, etc. You catch our drift. Open Source Founders Summit 
reserves the right to refuse admittance to, or remove any person from, any Open Source Founders Summit hosted 
event (including future Open Source Founders Summit events) at any time in its sole discretion. This includes, 
but is not limited to, attendees behaving in a disorderly manner or failing to comply with this policy, and the 
terms and conditions herein. If a participant engages in harassing or uncomfortable behavior, the event organizers 
may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning or expelling the offender from the event with no refund.

Our event staff can usually be identified by special badges/attire. Our zero tolerance policy means that we 
will look into and review every allegation of violation of our Event Community Guidelines and Anti-Harassment 
Policy and respond appropriately. Please note, while we take all concerns raised seriously, we will use our 
discretion as to determining when and how to follow up on reported incidents, and may decline to take any further 
action and/or may direct the participant to other resources for resolution.

Event staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide 
escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing discomfort or harassment to feel safe for the duration of the 
event. We value your attendance.

Exhibiting partners, sponsors or vendor booths, or similar activities are also subject to this policy. In 
particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Participants and 
exhibiting partners or sponsors disobeying this policy will be notified and are expected to stop any offending 
behavior immediately.

### Why this policy is important

Harassment at events and in online communities is unfortunately common. Creating an official policy aims to 
improve this by making it clear that harassment of anyone for any reason is not acceptable within our events 
and communities. This policy may prevent harassment by clearly defining expectations for behavior, aims to 
provide reassurance, and encourages people who have had bad experiences at other events to participate in this one.
