### Does the world really need another open source event? 

Open Source Founders Summit is a business conference, not a tech conference. Open source companies face challenges and opportunities that proprietary software companies never encounter. 
General startup programs, investors and your own employees often won’t understand how to navigate these 
challenges or take advantage of the opportunities unless they have open source experience. Open Source Founders Summit gives founders a place to learn from each other and support each other in building open source 
companies.

### What people said about OSFS 2024: 

“Thank you for organising this great event! Looking forward to the next year's already!”
	– Michael Widenius, founder of MySQL and MariaDB

 “For any current or future OSS founders in my network, if a very dense concentration of pertinent and actionable content delivered by smart and sincere speakers sounds like your cup of tea, keep an eye on their socials for next year’s dates.”
	– Eyal Bukchin, CTO and co-founder, MetalBear

 “Loved every moment of it. Thanks for taking the bet of building such a needed event. Looking forward for the second year!”
– Elisabeth Poirier-Defoy, deputy executive director, MobilityData

### What is different about OSFS?

**Not organized by a venture firm.** Unlike all the other open source business events, the primary organizers 
aren’t VCs — and including perspectives from both bootstrapped and venture-backed companies is important to us.

**Not DevTool focused:** Many successful open source companies don’t make DevTools. We want all open source 
companies to be part of the conversation.

**Practical info:** You’re a busy founder. OSFS is all about actionable takeaways you can put into practice 
immediately and fresh perspectives on your biggest challenges.

### A unique event format

**Morning talks:** Single-track talks that are both thought-provoking and actionable. No panels.

**Afternoon unconference workshops:** Afternoon breakout sessions where you can discuss specific challenges, 
from community building to sales to revenue building to acquisitions.

**Networking Breaks:** Social events to provide plenty of time & space for one-on-one conversations.
