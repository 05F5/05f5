<h3>Hotels near Le Loft des Écluses:</h3>
<p>
    <a href="https://www.lerobinetdor.com/">Le Robinet d'Or</a>
    is the closest hotel to the venue, and the most "Parisian." It is in a small, older building and
    the rooms are charming. This also means that there is no elevator, and the windows probably aren't completely
    soundproof. There's also very limited availability because it's a small hotel, so if this is your kind of place
    act fast.

<p>
    <a href="https://www.hotel-paris-louis-blanc.com/">Hotel Paris Louis Blanc</a>
    is a much larger hotel that is around the corner from the venue. The best thing about this
    hotel is an interior garden that, in May, would be a lovely place to have breakfast. It's the furthest of the
    hotels on this list, but we're talking about an additional 2 minutes walk, max, from the venue.

    is right next to the train station — the rooms on one side of the hotel look out at
    the tracks. If you choose this hotel, the upper floors on the train track side also have a fabulous view of the
    Eiffel Tower and Sacre Coeur. The downside is there is likely some noise from the trains, but it's also a modern
    building so not likely too bad.
